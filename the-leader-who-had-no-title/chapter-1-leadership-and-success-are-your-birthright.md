# Leadership and Success are Your Birthright

* Most of us are born into genius but die amid mediocrity. 
* We as humans, sometimes, worry about things that will never happen.
* Kurt Vonnegut said, *"The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your mind, the kind that blindside you at 4pm, some idle Tuesday evening"*.
* Invest in becoming a better thinker and developing a stronger mind. 
* Relentless learning is one of the main traits of an open and powerful person. 
* An obsessive and ongoing self-education is one of the greatest survival tactics to get through turbulent times.
