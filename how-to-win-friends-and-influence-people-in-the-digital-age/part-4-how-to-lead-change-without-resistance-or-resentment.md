# Part 4: How to Lead Change Without Resistance or Resentment

## Chapter 1: Begin on a Positive Note

* The first responsibility of a leader to state the reality. The last responsibility is to say thank you. In between, the leader is a servant. 
* It does little good to start off a conversation on a negative note. If the negative effect spreads like a virus through the various ranks of an organization, you might have to work against negative psychological reactions.
* Begin a conversation with an honest and genuine appreciation and the receiver shall be more receptive and less defensive to what you say. 
* Neuroscientists, have, in a variety of studies shown that human brains tend to focus on negative impressions, be they events or faults in others. 
* "Our negative brain tripwires are much more sensitive that our positive triggers". 
* When our brains are filled with negative impressions of others, it effects our perception of reality and seeps into our communication and we can't help but jump into the negative points first. 
* The critical point we make may become the listener's point of obsession and they may block out everything else that we have to say. 
* It's not just positive thinking but understanding that our perception of an event may not be inline with the truth. We should question the assumption that we made.
* We can train our microneurons systems:
    * to understand he actions of others
    * to interpret their intentions
    * to predict what they might do next
* If you do not like a colleague and you feel that they are not doing their work, you do not criticize. Instead, you write it down on a paper, and before you set out to change the other person's behavior, you note down three good points about them. 
* How to engage in interactions in which undesirable topics must be discussed:
    * The praise that you offer must be genuine and heartfelt. 
    * You must be able to create a smooth flow from point to point
    * Offer constructive advice rather than criticism following the praise. 
    * Do not use a "but" after the praise. The "but" may lead the listener to question the authenticity of the praise.
    * Instead, use an "and".
