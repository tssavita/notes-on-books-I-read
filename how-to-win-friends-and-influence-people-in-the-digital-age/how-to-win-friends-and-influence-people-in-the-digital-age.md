## Part 1

### Chapter 1

* Communicate to tear down somebody or build that person up
* Do not condemn, criticize or complain
* In today's day and age, compassion has become more prevalent than criticism and judgment than grace.
* Talking heads versus real leaders
* "As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation." - Hans Selye, endocrinologist
* When we use criticism to win an argument, we are taking two steps backward. 
* Venting out criticism may prove to be a release for you, but your influence will take a hit. 
* The moment you criticize, the subject of criticism is forced to defend. When a person is defensive, there is little that will break through their barrier. Every word is filtered through skepticism or complete incredulity. 
* It is best to remain clear about your own viewpoints, while at the same time, being compassionate and understanding towards others whose minds you would like to influence.
* Change by force of words is coercion is some scenarios. There is a reason it is a crime. While it may not always be a crime, it is always better to stay clear. 
* The simplest way to stay clear or coercion is to focus on the self:
    * Shift your aim to use the social media as an exhibition of your skills to providing value to others. 
        * Think why you are saying/posting the content. Is it because you have an ax to grind or is it because you would like to inform your colleagues and friends' circle of an issue to help them out.
        * Bragging and whining do not bring people closer. They might begin to think if they can trust you with their own mistakes and musings.
    * Resist badmouthing. 
        * The long term effect of badmouthing can be harmful. You might need to collaborate with the person in the future.
        * Competition is healthy. Collaboration is critical and should be protected. 

    * Make your messages meaningful
        *Do not publish from the point of view of what is most important to you. Publish with the aim of providing some value to the readers.
    * Calm yourself before communicating
        * Control the knee-jerk reaction to say what comes to your mind. If this is possible, a lot of hours of backpedaling, backscratching can be avoided.

* There is a Jewish proverb - In the way you judge, you will be judged. By your standard of measure, you will be measured.
* The greatest of leaders are ones who held their tongues and swallowed their pride. 

### Chapter 2

* Gaining influence is about setting yourself apart and stepping to a higher plane in the mind of the other. If you act and react like everybody else, you will never be able to be unique.
* We can be quite obsessed with the most superficial things. 

### Chapter 3: Connect with Core Desires

* To influence others to act, you must first connect to a core desire that lies within them. 
* Two insights that we often overlook when trying to influence others:
    * Influence requires more intuition than intellect. 
        * Influence is no respecter of education or experience. It goes only with the one who will set aside this status - be it high and mighty or low and lowly - and put herself in the place of the other. 
        * To do so, requires a shrewd and spontaneous ability to read beneath the surface of an interaction.
        * Antoine de Saint-Exupery, "What is essential is invisible to the eye."

## Part 3

### Avoid Arguments

* Avoid arguments and win grace and goodwill.
* Arguing with another person will not reach anywhere except for each person getting more firmly convinced of their own opinion.
* We will face conflict every day. The only way to prevent a tactful discussion from becoming an aggressive argument is to value interdependence than independence. 
* The Brazilian president Lula's mother said, two people can't fight if one person doesn't want to.
    * He considered himself a negotiator. 
* Corporate behavioral specialist Esther Jeles says, inside us all is "a vault of better self-understanding, higher knowledge and greater ideas. Tension and conflict occur when you and/or those with you discard the notion that others also have inner wisdom that ought to be heard."
