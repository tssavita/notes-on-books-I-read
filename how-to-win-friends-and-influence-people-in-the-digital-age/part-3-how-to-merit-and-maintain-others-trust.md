# Part 3

## Chapter 1: Avoid Arguments

* Avoid arguments and win grace and goodwill.
* Arguing with another person will not reach anywhere except for each person getting more firmly convinced of their own opinion.
* We will face conflict every day. The only way to prevent a tactful discussion from becoming an aggressive argument is to value interdependence than independence. 
* The Brazilian president Lula's mother said, two people can't fight if one person doesn't want to.
    * He considered himself a negotiator. 
* Corporate behavioral specialist Esther Jeles says, inside us all is "a vault of better self-understanding, higher knowledge and greater ideas. Tension and conflict occur when you and/or those with you discard the notion that others also have inner wisdom that ought to be heard."

## Chapter 2: Never Say, "You're  Wrong"

* The best solution, wisest decision, and brightest idea nearly always exists outside of what one party brings to the table. Yet we find it quite easy to declare the other person wrong without taking the time to understand what the other person is saying. 
* Harvard Business School professor and coauthor of Negotiation Genius, Deepak Malhotra says, "Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. Those who learn the wrong lessons from the past my be equally doomed."
* Deepak Malhotra says, "Negotiations become more productive when we realize that the other person may have legitimate concerns."
* Mahatma Gandhi says, "Friendship that insists upon an agreement on all matters is not worth the name. Friendship to be real must ever sustain the weight of honest differences, however sharp they be."
* Disagreement is a small crack in the wall that can be easily negotiated if we come to the discussion table with an open mind. 
* Corporate Behavioral specialist Esther Jeles mentioned something along the lines of:
    * We only bring to the table, what we know. 
    * We like to show off what we know and our skills.
    * We are expected to know something.
    * Sometimes this expectation works against us, because we close off possibilities that exist outside what we know. 
    * We then rebuke what others say and even the right of others to bring their own assessment to the table. 
* All problem solving begins with emptying of the mind.
* Acknowledging the possibility that we may not be the only person right, goes a long way in creating meaningful collaboration. 
* More often, we value personal victory over collaborative possibility.
* There is no point in denting a relationship by denting a person's ego. If you remember the times when you thought others were wrong, you can be fairly certain that others will also remember you in the same negative light. 
* "Default to diplomacy" and show the other some respect. Admit that you might be wrong, and that the other person may be right. 

## Chapter 4: Begin in a Friendly Way

* Successful leaders are always initiators. 
* We are more inclined to agree with another person if we are friendly with him. If we feel that the other person seems uninterested, we tend to mirror the sentiment. 
* When initiating the interaction, a gentle and affable tone is the most effective. 
* A friendly greeting says - "You are worth my time. You are valuable."
* "Trust is a social good to be protected just like air and water"
