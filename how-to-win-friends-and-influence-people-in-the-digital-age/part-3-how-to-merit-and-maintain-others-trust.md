# Part 3

## Chapter 1: Avoid Arguments

* Avoid arguments and win grace and goodwill.
* Arguing with another person will not reach anywhere except for each person getting more firmly convinced of their own opinion.
* We will face conflict every day. The only way to prevent a tactful discussion from becoming an aggressive argument is to value interdependence than independence. 
* The Brazilian president Lula's mother said, two people can't fight if one person doesn't want to.
    * He considered himself a negotiator. 
* Corporate behavioral specialist Esther Jeles says, inside us all is "a vault of better self-understanding, higher knowledge and greater ideas. Tension and conflict occur when you and/or those with you discard the notion that others also have inner wisdom that ought to be heard."

## Chapter 2: Never Say, "You're  Wrong"

* The best solution, wisest decision, and brightest idea nearly always exists outside of what one party brings to the table. Yet we find it quite easy to declare the other person wrong without taking the time to understand what the other person is saying. 
* Harvard Business School professor and coauthor of Negotiation Genius, Deepak Malhotra says, "Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it. Those who learn the wrong lessons from the past my be equally doomed."
* Deepak Malhotra says, "Negotiations become more productive when we realize that the other person may have legitimate concerns."
* Mahatma Gandhi says, "Friendship that insists upon an agreement on all matters is not worth the name. Friendship to be real must ever sustain the weight of honest differences, however sharp they be."
* Disagreement is a small crack in the wall that can be easily negotiated if we come to the discussion table with an open mind. 
* Corporate Behavioral specialist Esther Jeles mentioned something along the lines of:
    * We only bring to the table, what we know. 
    * We like to show off what we know and our skills.
    * We are expected to know something.
    * Sometimes this expectation works against us, because we close off possibilities that exist outside what we know. 
    * We then rebuke what others say and even the right of others to bring their own assessment to the table. 
* All problem solving begins with emptying of the mind.
* Acknowledging the possibility that we may not be the only person right, goes a long way in creating meaningful collaboration. 
* More often, we value personal victory over collaborative possibility.
* There is no point in denting a relationship by denting a person's ego. If you remember the times when you thought others were wrong, you can be fairly certain that others will also remember you in the same negative light. 
* "Default to diplomacy" and show the other some respect. Admit that you might be wrong, and that the other person may be right. 

## Chapter 3: Admit Faults Quickly and Emphatically

* There is a certain satisfaction in having the courage to admit one's faults. It clears the air of guilt and defensiveness.
* When we recognize and admit our mistakes quickly, the forgiveness in the eyes of others rises quickly. Only when we shirk off the responsibility do we iritate others. 

## Chapter 4: Begin in a Friendly Way

* Successful leaders are always initiators. 
* We are more inclined to agree with another person if we are friendly with him. If we feel that the other person seems uninterested, we tend to mirror the sentiment. 
* When initiating the interaction, a gentle and affable tone is the most effective. 
* A friendly greeting says - "You are worth my time. You are valuable."
* "Trust is a social good to be protected just like air and water"

## Chapter 5: Access Affinity

* When a person says no, there is a certain chain of psychological reactions that take place within us that makes us more defensive and ready to withdraw.
* The more yeses we get from an interaction, the more likely we are to agree with the other person. 
* When we start with a yes, we are creating affinity. But, to turn affinity to influence, there must be a foundation of empathy. 
* We must constantly be able to interact with another person, taking into account, her point of view. 
* You have to offer what _they_ want in order for them to begin with a yes, and maintain the yes. 
* Today there are agreements:
    * The first kind of agreement is one that comes out of two parties holding the same value.
    * The second kind of agreement is two people taking a liking to the same thing. 
* The more early yeses we get, the more likely we are to succeed in the future. 
* _Access affinity as early as possible_
